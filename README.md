### Project: Zookeeper

#### About
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

#### Learning outcomes
This project is aimed at our beginners. It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.

#### *Personal Notes:
Just a fun and rather arbitrary project. Good working through it, as the lessons content helped in brushing up on some of the basics. I also learned some nuances to some of the core concepts of Python, which had not been covered in the other Python courses I have taken.

The program is very basic by design and assumes the "Developer" has provided training to the "Zookeeper" on how the program works and its limitations. Thus any selections above the index of 5 will break the program and throw an IndexError: list index out of range.

Also the zookeeper would be aware that they could exit the program with the input "exit".

That is it...

You have input choices in a range of 0 through 5, of which you can switch between indefinitely as an infinite loop has been used intentionally for this purpose, and an exit input is required to be implemented to end the program, once you are done checking on the well-being of the denizens of this rather limited Zoo, of course. ;)

That is the extent of the program.

No error catches etc. have or been or will be considered.

Now go check out the Rabbits habitat... fascinating.
